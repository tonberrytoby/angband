Angband 3.3.0
=============

We, the Angband development team, are proud to present the latest 
iteration of the game, in the form of Angband 3.3.0. This time there 
will definitely be a 3.3.1 bugfix release for any serious bugs, but we 
hope this version is enjoyable. All major fixes and changes are 
described below. This version sees more significant refactoring, 
especially of the input layer, and the first major changes to dungeon 
generation for many years. It also adds a comprehensive stats collection 
module, which will be used to improve balance in future versions.

This release was brought to you by (in alphabetical order of IRC 
nickname): Aerdan, Erik Osheim, Elly Jones, Aaron Bader, Chris Carr, 
Robert Au, Peter Denison and Andi Sidwell. Please see the file 
thanks.txt for a full list of contributors.
